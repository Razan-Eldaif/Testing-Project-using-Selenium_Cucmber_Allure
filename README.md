# Testing Project using Selenium, Cucumber and Allure

## Description
This project automates the testing of drag-and-drop functionality for web applications. The testing framework uses **Cucumber** for writing behavior-driven development (BDD) scenarios, and **Selenium** for executing these tests in the Chrome browser. Currently, the project includes four test cases focused on dragging elements within a designated area and outside it, with plans to expand functionality and support multiple browsers in the future.

## Features
- Automated testing of drag-and-drop functionality using **Selenium**.
- Cucumber for defining test scenarios in an easy-to-read format.
- Currently supports testing in **Chrome**, with plans to include other browsers.
- Test reporting through **Allure**.

## Requirements
- Java 23 or higher
- Maven
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (ensure it's compatible with your Chrome version)
- Allure CommandLine.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Razan-Eldaif/Testing-Project-using-Selenium_Cucmber_Allure.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Testing-Project-using-Selenium_Cucmber_Allure
   ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run the tests using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
3. To view the test reports generated by Allure, run:
   ```bash
   mvn allure:serve
   ```

## Test Cases
The project currently includes four test cases you cand find them here [Test Cases](test_cases.md)

## Future Plans
- Expand the test cases to cover Accessiability Testing for drag-and-drop page.
- Add support for additional browsers like Firefox and Edge.
- Implement additional functionalities for comprehensive testing of other web interactions.
